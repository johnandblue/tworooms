## Motivation

After the discovery of the game, and enjoy playing it with friends, we decided to develop the app as a part of the seniors projects in the Codeworks Bootcamp. We thought it was a nice idea, that could be used by many people that don't have access to the real card deck. The theme is based on Star Wars characters
